3. CONTEXT
Dear [Name of the DHO of Amuru],

A few months ago, the biostatistician of Amuru filled in our survey around ‘Precision public health at district and sub-national levels’. Thank you very much for the commitment of your district.
Following up on this survey, we are now contacting you with a first analytical report that aims to show you what is happening in your district regarding the continuity of essential health services (CEHS). In this first report, we focus on 12 indicators. Once you have thoroughly analysed this report, please fill in this survey to share your feedback. The next analytical report will gradually contain new information regarding CEHS, based on your wishes (see also 'Next Steps' below). We will also contact you shortly to set up a meeting, to discuss your feedback in more detail. Your efforts are of high importance to Uganda’s health response capabilities.
This analytical report is offered to you by the Sub-national Precision Public Health initiative from the Division of Health Information of the Ugandan Ministry of Health.

4. METHODOLOGY
Data source. The graphs and numbers shown in this report are generated based on data collected from DHIS2 and covering January 2018 up until September 2020.
Data quality. Sometimes, these insights do not represent what is really happening in your district. There can be two reasons for that: (1) the data that was entered by your district was wrong data, (2) some health facilities or community health workers did not enter data at all. 
What does this all mean? As the numbers are sensitive to wrong data entry and low reporting rates, we need to keep a critical mindset when looking at these data insights. In order to improve the quality of data reports like these, health facilities might need additional support to improve reporting on all indicators in a correct way.

5. DATA DASHBOARD
You are invited to analyze the CEHS data concerning your district, other districts and Uganda as a whole, on this dashboard: https://uganda-cehs.herokuapp.com/

6. NEXT STEPS
Next indicators. We aim to cover all the WHO-selected CEHS indicators and other relevant CEHS indicators in this series of monthly sub-national reports. The ones we are currently working on are related to maternal, natal and child health (MNCH), gender-based violence (GBV), malaria, non-communicable diseases (NCD), nutrition, tuberculosis (TB) and a few more on HIV. Which ones will come first, will partly depend on your feedback given in the survey and our meetings.
Date of the next report. The next report will feature October 2020 and is expected to be published beginning of December.
